This is a tool for bulk encrypting all files in a directory structure using ChaCha20-Poly1305


Quick usage guide:

Generate an encryption key: (Do not lose your key, it's impossible to recover. Also don't use this one.)
	>BulkFileEncrypter.exe generate
	key: fovwUKj+tsVdo9VU1pnTBjKU1rmIUI++LaRG/j2O9cc=

Use this key to encrypt a directory:
	>BulkFileEncrypter.exe encrypt c:\temp\original c:\temp\encrypted fovwUKj+tsVdo9VU1pnTBjKU1rmIUI++LaRG/j2O9cc=

Decrypt files with the same key:
	>BulkFileEncrypter.exe decrypt c:\temp\encrypted c:\temp\decrypted fovwUKj+tsVdo9VU1pnTBjKU1rmIUI++LaRG/j2O9cc=



Requirements for build:
.NET 7 SDK
