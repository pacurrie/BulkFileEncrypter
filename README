This is a tool for bulk encrypting a directory structure


Quick usage guide:

Generate an encryption key:
	>BulkFileEncrypter.exe generate
	Generated key: prMA0S3K5Bdv8tDyJbFKFR4U01hKwdUFCPYRU+pZv7M=

Use this key to encrypt a directory (do not lose your key, it's impossible to recover):
	>BulkFileEncrypter.exe encrypt -s c:\temp\original -d c:\temp\encrypted -k prMA0S3K5Bdv8tDyJbFKFR4U01hKwdUFCPYRU+pZv7M=

Decrypt files with the same key:
	>BulkFileEncrypter.exe decrypt -s c:\temp\encrypted -d c:\temp\decrypted -k prMA0S3K5Bdv8tDyJbFKFR4U01hKwdUFCPYRU+pZv7M=



Requirements for build:
Visual Studio 2012 and .NET 4.5 (probably easily portable to .NET 3.5)
You need to download the CLR Security DLLs separately due to licensing restrictions. Download the clrsecurity_june10.zip from the site and unpack it to a directory named "clrsecurity_june10" parallel to this directory.
